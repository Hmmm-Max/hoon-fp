# hoon-fp

## Completed

* Basic operations, rounding (not very fast, but code is short and running time is bounded to input and output precision)
* Conversion between IEEE754 format

## In progress

* Float-to-decimal (Dragon4), Decimal-to-float

## Planned

* Elementary functions (trigonometric, logarithm, exponent...)
* Jets for multiple-precision (using MPFR which is under LGPL license)
* Jets for ++rd, ++rs, possibly ++rq

## Not planned ATM:

* Signalling NaN
* Decimal floating point
