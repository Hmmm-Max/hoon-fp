# hoon-fp

## Completed

* Basic operations, rounding (not very fast, but code is short and running time is bounded to input and output precision)
* Conversion between IEEE754 format
* Float-to-decimal (Dragon4), Decimal-to-float
* Fix parsers, printing
* Elementary functions (trigonometric, logarithm, exponent...)
* Jets for ++rd, ++rs, ++rq (SoftFloat)

## In progress

* Jet for Dragon4
* Misc cleanup

## Planned

* Fractal demo
* ++fl basic operation jets?
* Elementary functions will be cleaned up, placed in a library

## Not planned ATM

* Flags, signalling NaN
* Decimal floating point operations
* Power function
